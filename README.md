# model-validation-eos30gr


 The repository is organized into several folders:
 
  * `/notebooks`: Contains Jupyter notebooks where the most work is developed.
  * `/data`: Holds all csv files. Model predictions, obtained externally, are saved here. Subfolders may be created if needed.
  * `/src`: Stores important functions for reuse throughout the repository, reducing the need for repetitive typing.
  * `/figures`: Contains plots produced during the model validation process.
    
  Additionally, there's a `requirements.txt` file listing all required packages to run the notebooks in this repository.
